# Country Unemployment Clustering

## About This Project
A data analysis project that performs clustering on global unemployment data to identify groups of countries with similar unemployment characteristics. This project uses Python and Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, apply clustering algorithms, and visualize the results for better insights into global unemployment trends.

## Tech Stack & Tools
| Category     | Stack                        |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| Data Analysis| Python (Pandas, NumPy)        |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn (KMeans Clustering) |
| Visualization | Matplotlib, Seaborn          |
| Notebook     | Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)     |

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of global unemployment dataset.
- Application of KMeans clustering to group countries.
- Visualization of clustering results for analytical insights.
- Export of clustered results to CSV for further usage.

## Live Demo
This project is intended to be run locally in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Installation and Usage (Local Setup)
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/MacOS
    # OR
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```
3. Install project dependencies.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Clusters.ipynb
    ```
5. Run all cells to see data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization results.

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add Elbow Method to determine optimal cluster count dynamically.
- [ ] Incorporate more socioeconomic indicators (GDP, HDI) for multi-factor clustering.
- [ ] Develop a web-based visualization dashboard for interactive exploration.
- [ ] Deploy the notebook as a Streamlit web application for easier access.
